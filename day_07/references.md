Here are a few useful sites that go over the basic fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is an awesome **free** resource.

* [Codeschool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/) are also good
resources that have great video tutorials, but they have a monthly fee.  But that shouldn't stop you from
signing up for a free trial

* [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) has great documentation on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you can browse.

* [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

# HTML and CSS resources

* [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/) has a really cool index that gives a rundown of all the different HTML elements.
* [CSS Reference](https://www.cssreference.io) was used a lot in class.  I love the examples that this site gives on all the different
css properties.  Also very easy to search this site.
* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) has a really useful almanac on all the CSS Properties and Selectors available to us.  The Snippets
on the site also has some really useful tutorials.
* [HTML and CSS](http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/) by Jon Duckett is a phenomenal book that goes over the basics of HTML and CSS.
I can't recommend it enough, it is an amazing reference guide that has some fantastic tutorials in it.  You can purchase it on Amazon or
attempt to find a free PDF version of it online ;)

# JavaScript Resources

* [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is an amazing book that is also available for free online.  Highly recommended.
* [jQuery documentation](http://api.jquery.com/)
* [JavaScript and jQuery](http://javascriptbook.com/) is another fantastic book by Jon Duckett.  Again, you can purchase it on Amazon.

# Other Various Resources

* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) is cool for quickly testing some HTML, CSS, and/or JS
* [Google Hosted Libraries](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/) is where we can get a script tag for some JS libraries (like jQuery).
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
* [Githbub Desktop Guides](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/)
* [ColorZilla](http://www.colorzilla.com/chrome/) is a Chrome extension that allows you to pick a specific color on a web page.
* [Here](https://atom.io/packages/list) is a list of the most popular Atom packages.  Browse through them and see which ones you would want to
add to Atom.

## Adding Atom Packages
* When Atom is open, click on 'Atom' in the menu bar and choose preferences.  You can also open preferences by clicking Command + ,
* Once your preferences is open, look at the menu on the left and click 'Install'.
* From here, you can search whatever Atom package you are interested in and install it.
* You can view what packages you have installed by clicking on 'Packages' in your preferences menu.
